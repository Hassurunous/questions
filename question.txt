What was your favorite project to work on and why?
My first game was incredibly fun. It was a flappy bird clone that had my head and my voice and would go “Yo” every time you tapped the screen while jumping through beer bottles.


How did you discover Make School?
I got an ad from my friend about it since I was complaining about how I’m not learning anything in my classes at all. It was a great jump into the experience that I will never regret.
